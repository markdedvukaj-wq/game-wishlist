# game-wishlist
This is my CSI-1320 Final Project called, Videogame Wishlist Manager. This project allows you to add or remove a list of games you own or do not own and add their prices.

This project demonstrates:
user interaction with input() and print(),
conditional logic (with relational & logical operators)
loops,
arithmetic expressions and multiple data types,
lists and dictionaries,
adding, deleting, and modifying data structures,
reading and writing data from files, and
custom functions and modular design

To run this code in Linux you have to type

python3 gamewishlist.py
