# game-wishlist
This is my CSI-1320 Final Project called, Videogame Wishlist Manager. This project allows you to add or remove a list of games you own or do not own and add their prices.

This project demonstrates:
user interaction with input() and print(),
conditional logic (with relational & logical operators)
loops,
arithmetic expressions and multiple data types,
lists and dictionaries,
adding, deleting, and modifying data structures,
reading and writing data from files, and
custom functions and modular design
