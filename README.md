# game-wishlist
This is my CSI-1320 Final Project called, Videogame Wishlist Manager. This project allows you to add or remove a list of games you own or do not own and add their prices.

This project demonstrates:
User interaction with input() and print()
Conditional logic (with relational & logical operators)
Loops
Arithmetic expressions and multiple data types
Lists + dictionaries
Adding, deleting, and modifying data structures
Reading and writing data from files
Custom functions and modular design
